# Girl's Frontline (GFL) dialogue extract
Python code to extract dialogue spoken by a specified character from the hit game Girl's Frontline

Just run extract.py

Disclaimer:
- Some characters speak under two names
- For example: RO635 is both RO and RO635 in dialogue. Same problem for Ange, she is both Ange and Angelia
- For this edge case, run the program again to cover dialogue for both aliases
- Also look at errors at the bottom

~~In theory this also works for other characters if you edit the code a bit~~

Works for all characters now yay!!!


All event text copy pasted from https://gfl.amaryllisworks.pw/
- Disclaimer: All chapters not included yet, im too lazy to copy them all


To-Do:

- ~~output specific character dialogue text files to separate folder~~ done... kinda
- ~~handle ascii characters or at least this thing: �~~ done
- ~~figure out how to convert from text file to csv without errors~~ done
- ~~dynamic character dialogue extracting, specify which character to extract dialogue for on program start~~ done
