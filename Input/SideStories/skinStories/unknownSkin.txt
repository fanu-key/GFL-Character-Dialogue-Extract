...In the dark dorm room.

M4 SOPMOD II: RO, I'm all dressed and ready! Let's go!

M4 SOPMOD II: Huh? Where is everybody...?

SOP-II turns on her communicator and finally finds the message that RO has left her.

RO635: M4 and I have gone on to the venue to help out with the preparations.

RO635: Come and join us once you've collected your dress.

RO635: It's getting busy, so see you later.

Playback over.

M4 SOPMOD II: Huh...

SOP-II looks down at the two wine glasses in her hands.

M4 SOPMOD II: I was going to have a drink with you before we set off...

M4 SOPMOD II: But now...nobody's bossing me around! Ehehe...

RO635: She bounds happily onto RO's bed then leaps over onto M4's bed...

RO635: The dark dorm echoes with SOP-II's laughter...

A few minutes later, there is a polite knock on the door.

???: Hello? We have a delivery for you.

M4 SOPMOD II: ...Who's that?

SOP-II gets off M4's bed and walks over to answer the door.

M4 SOPMOD II: What kind of delivery?

MG34: Hello, Miss SOP-II. Is Miss M4 in?

M4 SOPMOD II: Nope, I'm the only one here at the moment.

MG34: I see...

MG34: Then could you please accept this delivery on her behalf? It seems to be an urgent order.

M4 SOPMOD II: Sure!

SOP-II gladly signs for the delivery.

MG34: Thanks!

MG34: Don't forget to leave us a review!

SOP-II hauls M4's package into the dorm.

M4 SOPMOD II: ...It's kinda heavy. What can it be?

SOP-II glances at M4's bed. A cushion stares back silently.

M4 SOPMOD II: I-I'll just take one peek... I won't mess anything up!

She opens the lid carefully.

A piece of paper comes into view.

Paper Note: SOP-II, DO NOT OPEN!!!

M4 SOPMOD II: ...

SOP-II closes up the lid indignantly and looks towards M4's bed again.

M4 SOPMOD II: Humph, you think I'd let a single note stop me, M4?

SOP-II flings the lid open once more and tosses away the note.

M4 SOPMOD II: Whoa! She bought so many bottles of liquor!

M4 SOPMOD II: Different kinds, too...

M4 SOPMOD II: This looks like something fancy...

She holds up one of the bottles.

It comes with an eye-catching label.

Label: I beg you, SOP-II. You can do whatever you want with the others, just leave this one alone.

M4 SOPMOD II: ...

M4 SOPMOD II: How could she tell I'd be curious about THIS one?!

M4 SOPMOD II: Argh, forget it. Since she said I could do anything I want with the other bottles, I'm gonna do just that. Hehehe...

SOP-II gleefully trawls through the rest of the package until a pink bottle catches her eye.

M4 SOPMOD II: What's this? The color goes really well with my dress...

M4 SOPMOD II: Hm... What's this cherry brandy?

M4 SOPMOD II: "Know your limit. Excessive consumption of this beverage may cause hallucinations..."

M4 SOPMOD II: Heheh, who cares? I'm gonna taste it!

She pops open the bottle and chugs it eagerly.

The strong aroma of cherry blossom washes over her throat, then comes the pronounced flavor of black cherries mixed with a tinge of citrus.

Soon after that, the rich taste of cocoa interlaced with a hint of smokiness seeps through slowly.

At the same time, there is also a milky sweetness and the zestiness of grapefruit...

M4 SOPMOD II: This tastes amazing...

M4 SOPMOD II: I could lose myself in this coziness...

SOP-II starts taking gulp after gulp...

SOP-II loses count of how much she has drunk, all she knows is that her body is getting lighter and lighter, until she's practically floating...

M4 SOPMOD II: Huh... Where am I floating to...?

M4 SOPMOD II: Hehehehe... I'm so happy...

M4 SOPMOD II: The whole world is beautiful...

M4 SOPMOD II: I'm flying...

...

M4 SOPMOD II: Huh, where am I?

M4 SOPMOD II: Why is there a sea of flowers? I thought I was at the banquet venue...

M4 SOPMOD II: I'm wearing a different dress?

RO635: There you are, Princess SOP-II.

M4 SOPMOD II: I... What are you talking about, RO? And what are you wearing?

RO635: Is something the matter, Your Highness? Are you hungry?

M4 SOPMOD II: Huh...?

RO635: I have prepared some snacks. Please enjoy.

SOP-II rubs her eyes.

RO635: ...SOP-II! SOP-II, stop spacing out!

SOP-II finally snaps out of it and finds herself at the bustling banquet hall.

Glamorously dressed Dolls are chatting and dancing all around her...

And a scowling RO is shaking her.

M4 SOPMOD II: Huh, you've changed again, RO?

RO shoves a plate of pastries into SOP-II's hands.

RO635: What nonsense are you talking about? I've been wearing the same thing and helping out at the venue the whole time.

RO635: Take this. I saved you some pastries. I quite literally guarded them with my life. They wouldn't have survived much longer if you hadn't shown up.

M4 SOPMOD II: Heheh, thanks. But why aren't you calling me "Your Highness" anymore?

RO635: ...What Highness?

RO635: Never mind, I don't have time for chit-chat. I need to get back to work. Stay out of trouble, okay?

M4 SOPMOD II: Sure, gotcha!

RO rushes off in a hurry.

M4 SOPMOD II: Why didn't RO remember anything...?

M4 SOPMOD II: Or did I actually imagine the whole thing?

SOP-II holds her plate of pastries in one hand and takes another swig from her bottle.

M4 SOPMOD II: Hm? Where am I?

M4 SOPMOD II: I thought I was at the banquet!

She takes in the tranquil lakeside, dumbfounded. The Dolls that were all impeccably dressed just a second ago have suddenly sprouted bunny ears and look as if they've walked right out of a fairy tale.

SOP-II approaches the crowd curiously. She notices a familiar Doll walking slowly into the distance with a big bunch of balloons in her hand.

M4 SOPMOD II: M4! M4, you're here, too!

M4A1: ...

M4 SOPMOD II: Where did you get so many balloons?

M4A1: I'm leaving, SOP-II.

M4 SOPMOD II: Where are you going?

M4A1: I'm going somewhere far, far away...

M4 SOPMOD II: Then I'm coming with you.

M4A1: It's a long way from here...

M4A1: We must say our goodbyes here.

The balloons gradually lift M4 off the ground.

M4 SOPMOD II: Don't go! I won't let you go!

M4 SOPMOD II: SOP-II lunges at M4 and refuses to let go...

M4A1: ...SOP-II! Let go of me!

M4 SOPMOD II: Huh?

M4 SOPMOD II: Where are your balloons?

SOP-II, utterly confused, releases M4.

M4A1: Phew I can finally breathe...

M4A1: What happened, SOP-II? Why did you suddenly charge at me?

M4 SOPMOD II: You just told me you were leaving...

M4A1: Where would I go?

M4 SOPMOD II: I don't know, but you said you were going somewhere far, far away.

M4 SOPMOD II: A place so far that I'll never find you...

M4A1: ...

M4A1: That's not going to happen. I'm right here.

M4 SOPMOD II: ...Okay!

M4A1: Is everything alright, then? I've got something to do, so I'll be heading off to find 15 and the others.

M4 peers anxiously at SOP-II again before making her way to the photo studio.

M4 SOPMOD II: What is going on?

M4 SOPMOD II: Why do I keep seeing strange things...?

SOP-II takes another sip from her bottle to calm her nerves.

M4 SOPMOD II: I'm back again?!

M4 SOPMOD II: ...

M4 SOPMOD II: Doesn't really matter...as long as everyone is still here.

M4 SOPMOD II: M4 has become...a balloon vendor here, hehehe...

M4 SOPMOD II: RO's also got bunny ears! I wonder what 15 and 16 look like?

She giggles giddily as she walks into the crowd.

M4 SOPMOD II: You're all so cute! Can I have a hug?!

T-Doll: Uh...sure...

M4 SOPMOD II: Hehehe...

She flits through the flowerbeds and enfolds every Doll she encounters in a bear hug.

ST AR-15: ...

M4 SOPMOD II: 15, there you are!

ST AR-15: SOP-II, can you take this bouquet and give it to M4?

M4 SOPMOD II: Sure, but where are you going?

ST AR-15: ...

ST AR-15: I'm doing what must be done.

M4 SOPMOD II: ...

ST AR-15: Hurry, SOP-II.

ST AR-15: M4 is still waiting for you. Protect her. I'm counting on you...

This nightmarish scene starts playing in SOP-II's mind.

M4 SOPMOD II: NO! NO, NO, NO, NO!

M4 SOPMOD II: I'm not letting you go this time!

SOP-II grabs ST AR-15 by the collar...

ST AR-15: ...What's gotten into you, SOP-II?

M4 SOPMOD II: (Sobs) 15...

ST AR-15: A-Are you okay?

ST AR-15: What happened? Did someone bully you?

M4 SOPMOD II: You were leaving me behind again...

ST AR-15: No, I wasn't.

M4 SOPMOD II: I saw you!

ST AR-15: ...

ST AR-15: Your memory is all jumbled. Here, have a drink to cool your head.

M4 SOPMOD II: Okay.

SOP-II passes her bottle to ST AR-15.

ST AR-15: Let's drink together and chase away the bad memories.

M4 SOPMOD II: Then be prepared to down a few glasses. I was devastated...

ST AR-15: ...

ST AR-15: Alright, alright, I'll drink a few with you.

M4 SOPMOD II: Hehe, M4 bought this! It tastes really good!

ST AR-15: What? You opened M4's—

Exploiting ST AR-15's momentary shock, SOP-II grabs her chin and pours the contents of the bottle into her mouth.

M4 SOPMOD II: Good, drink up!

ST AR-15: (Gargles)

The bottle is soon empty. SOP-II lets go of ST AR-15.

M4 SOPMOD II: Hehe... Now have a pastry! RO saved them for me!

M4 SOPMOD II: I'll let you have two... No, I'll let you have one!

ST AR-15: ...

ST AR-15 slumps onto the floor in a daze.

M4 SOPMOD II: You don't want it? Then they're all mine!

SOP-II gobbles up a mint-flavored cookie.

M4 SOPMOD II: (Munches)

M4 SOPMOD II: How refreshing... I-I'm floating again!

She starts running against the strong breeze blowing into her face.

The branches and leaves rustle as she passes by, and petals dance in the air...

M4 SOPMOD II: MUAHAHAHAHAHA! I'm as fast as the wind!

ST AR-15's Voice: Wait, SOP-II!

ST AR-15's shout is left in the dust.

M4 SOPMOD II: I'm flying! I'm flying!!!

Panicking Doll: Oh my goodness, what is she doing?!

The gust SOP-II kicked up sends the Dolls' skirts flying, causing a series of shrieks.

Calm Doll: Stop her!

M4 SOPMOD II: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

M4 SOPMOD II: Nobody can catch me!

SOP-II darts nimbly into a bush of flowers.

Panicking Doll: She's gone! Can anyone spot her?

M4 SOPMOD II: Hehehe. Now which cookie should I try?

She picks out a raspberry-flavored cookie and pops it into her mouth.

M4 SOPMOD II: (Munches)

M4 SOPMOD II: ...

M4 SOPMOD II: I'm...brimming with power...!

SOP-II crawls out from the bush and brushes right past a knightly white rabbit.

M4 SOPMOD II: M16!

M16A1: SOP-II, what are you doing here?

M4 SOPMOD II: Where are you going?

M16 is caught off-guard for a moment, but she quickly hides her surprise with a dashing smile.

M16A1: I was just grabbing something for M4.

M4 SOPMOD II: I'll do it! No one runs faster than me!

M16A1: Haha, but M4 assigned the mission to me.

M4 SOPMOD II: Why...

M16A1: Don't worry, you'll have your answers eventually.

M4 SOPMOD II: ...

M16A1: Stick together with RO, got that?

M16 smiles at SOP-II and pats her on the head, then she turns to leave.

M4 SOPMOD II: ...

M4 SOPMOD II: Don't go.

M16A1: What?

SOP-II dashes towards M16 at full speed...

M4 SOPMOD II: HAAAAAAAAGH!

SOP-II throws her arms tightly around M16's waist and lifts her right up.

M16A1: What the hell?!

M16A1: SOP-II, what are you doing?

M4 SOPMOD II: I won't let you— Huh? You're back...

M4A1: SOP-II what are you doing?!

M16A1: It's okay, M4.

SOP-II puts M16 back down in a daze. M4 walk up to them, her face filled with worry.

M4A1: Are you okay, SOP-II?

M4 SOPMOD II: ...I'm fine! Never been better!

M16A1: You've been drinking quite a bit, haven't you?

M4 SOPMOD II: Hehe... Nope...

Before M4 and M16 can stop her, she shoves another green cookie into her mouth and runs off.

M4A1: SOP-II!

M16A1: Don't worry, M4. Someone will go after her.

M16, the very picture of self-assurance, grins as she spots the Doll running in this direction.

...Unlike the lively sea of flowers, right now the lakeside is completely quiet and deserted.

M4 SOPMOD II: I'm back again...

SOP-II wades into the glistening lake and sends the water splashing.

M4 SOPMOD II: Where did everybody go?

On the silent lake, the rippling water is all she can hear.

SOP-II comes to a halt. She stares at the surface of the lake, which she has disturbed.

A strange feeling threatens to overwhelm her.

M4 SOPMOD II: ...Hm, I'm bored.

M4 SOPMOD II: I wonder what RO and the others are doing...

SOP-II sits down on the shore with her feet still submerged in the water.

M4 SOPMOD II: ...

M4 SOPMOD II: I miss them...

M4 SOPMOD II: Why haven't they come?

The lake offers her no answer.

M4 SOPMOD II: I don't like this place.

M4 SOPMOD II: The view is a lot nicer than at the base and the Dolls here have bunny ears...

M4 SOPMOD II: But my friends aren't here.

M4 SOPMOD II: ...

M4 SOPMOD II: I miss them. I'm going to find them!

Suddenly burning with purpose, she rises to her feet.

M4 SOPMOD II: RO—!

M4 SOPMOD II: M4—!

M4 SOPMOD II: 15—! 16—!

The echoes drift away like ripples on the lake.

M4 SOPMOD II: RO... M4... 15... 16...

M4 SOPMOD II: (Sobs)

M4 SOPMOD II: Where are you?

SOP-II's voice starts shaking uncontrollably.

M4 SOPMOD II: Don't leave me behind...

M4 SOPMOD II: I don't want to be alone...

RO635's Voice: SOP-II!

M4 SOPMOD II: RO? It's RO!

M4 SOPMOD II: RO, I'm here!

SOP-II wipes away her tears immediately and shouts back at RO, who's running towards her.

RO635: SOP-II—!

M4 SOPMOD II: RO—!

SOP-II flings her arms wide open, ready to catch RO.

But the moment RO comes into contact, she restrains SOP-II with practiced ease and handcuffs her.

M4 SOPMOD II: Huh?

RO635: Now, count up your sins!!!

M4 SOPMOD II: The world recedes rapidly around SOP-II.

When she finally recovers, she finds herself sitting in the fountain outside the banquet venue.

M4 SOPMOD II: ...How did I get here?

RO635: ...

RO635: Finally awake?

RO635: You drank too much and your neural cloud was a wreck.

M4 SOPMOD II: Oh... Did I get into trouble?

RO635: You need to ask? M4 and the others are sorting things out for you.

M4 SOPMOD II: Uh... Sorry...

RO635: RO wrings the water out of her dress impassively. Then she takes a handkerchief out of her handbag and dries SOP-II's face.

M4 SOPMOD II: RO!

RO635: What?

M4 SOPMOD II: Are you angry with me?

RO635: ...No.

RO sighs. She drags SOP-II out of the fountain and wrings her dress for her.

RO635: Let's go and get you out of the wet clothes.

M4 SOPMOD II: Yay!

RO635: You're not allowed to drink from now on.

M4 SOPMOD II: Huh? Oh, c'mon!

RO635: Don't you "c'mon" me! I will not give in!

The two Dolls bicker the whole way back to the dorm.

Despite being soaking wet and missing out on the banquet...

SOP-II has never been happier today.
